The layout of the website is very nice, and I especially like the shop section, which presents everything very nicely. One big diffirence I noticed is that each page 
has it's own CSS file. It can be good to keep files specific to certain pages, but having one for every page can lead to style inconsistances and make it harder to maintain the codebase. There is also no folder for images, but since only one image is local, I don't see this as a problem, since one could easily be added without much headache. I think 
the page does have some inconsistent style problems, mainly with colors and fonts. Some of the font choices (The serif font used in paragraphs) look a little weird, though this may just be me personally. There are inconsistant color and border choices across the website though, which is a little bit weird. I think sticking to one or 2 shades of pink would help it look more cohesive, and either using borders around everything that is in a box, or borders around nothing. Also, some areas could use a bit more padding, mostly around text, and especially on the about me page, which has no padding and looks a bit cramped.
